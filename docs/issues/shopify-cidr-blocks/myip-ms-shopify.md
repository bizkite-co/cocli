## [How to Use Myip.ms for Shopify]{#How_to_Use_Myipms_for_Shopify} {#h-how-to-use-myip-ms-for-shopify .wp-block-heading}

Here is a simple detailed step-by-step guide on using Myip.ms to find top Shopify stores.

### [1. [Go to Myip.ms](https://myip.ms/){rel="nofollow noopener"}]{#1_Go_to_Myipms} {#h-1-go-to-myip-ms .wp-block-heading}

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/thecleverbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/myip.ms_.jpg?resize=981%2C491&amp;ssl=1" class="wp-image-19064" data-recalc-dims="1" data-fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/thecleverbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/myip.ms_.jpg?w=981&amp;ssl=1 981w, https://i0.wp.com/thecleverbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/myip.ms_.jpg?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/thecleverbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/myip.ms_.jpg?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 981px) 100vw, 981px" width="981" height="491" alt="Myip.ms homepage" />
</figure>

Myip.ms is a WHOIS IP lookup service that enables you to find the hosting company of any website. It also allows you to reverse WHOIS, meaning that you can see a list of sites on a specific IP address or IP range.

To start finding top Shopify stores, first, go to Myip.ms.

### [2. Enter Shopify's IP Address in the Myip.ms Search Field]{#2_Enter_Shopifys_IP_Address_in_the_Myipms_Search_Field} {#h-2-enter-shopify-s-ip-address-in-the-myip-ms-search-field .wp-block-heading}

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/thecleverbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/myip.ms-shopify-search-field.jpg?resize=749%2C185&amp;ssl=1" class="wp-image-19072" data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/thecleverbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/myip.ms-shopify-search-field.jpg?w=749&amp;ssl=1 749w, https://i0.wp.com/thecleverbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/myip.ms-shopify-search-field.jpg?resize=300%2C74&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" width="749" height="185" alt="Myip.ms search field" />
</figure>

On Myip.ms, enter [Shopify's IP address](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/os/domains/managing-domains/troubleshooting){rel="nofollow noopener"} into the search field.

You can either type in [`23.227.38.32`]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}, [`23.227.38.36`]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}, [`23.227.38.65`]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}, or [`23.227.38.74`]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}. They are all owned by Shopify.

Another way is to enter **myshopify.com** -- Shopify's reserve DNS.

Then, click the button "WHOIS Lookup."

### [3. Check for Other Shopify Sites on IP]{#3_Check_for_Other_Shopify_Sites_on_IP} {#h-3-check-for-other-shopify-sites-on-ip .wp-block-heading}

Now, you should be able to see information related to Shopify's IP Address, including IP Location, IP Reserve DNS, IP Range, etc.

</figure>

To find all other Shopify sites, click "Other Sites On IP."

### [4. Look for Shopify Site Records]{#4_Look_for_Shopify_Site_Records} {#h-4-look-for-shopify-site-records .wp-block-heading}

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

After clicking the button, scroll down the page until you see a table. This is a preview list of all Shopify stores. Click "View All Records" at the bottom right corner to open the entire list in more detail.
