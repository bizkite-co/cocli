# Directory Data Structure

We can provide a data hierarchy and ad hoc links with directories and symlinks

## Directories

- Directory paths provide content hierarchy
- Indexes in roots and nodes can provide abreviated lookups for deeper content. 
- The hierarchy helps organize data relations.

## Symlinks

- Links provide access to related data outside the hierarchy
