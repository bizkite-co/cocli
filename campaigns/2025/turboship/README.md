# Turboship Campaign

This campaign is focused on ingesting and enriching customer data from Turboship, a Shopify store. The goal is to market products related specifically to installers and service providers for vinyl and lenoleum flooring, sports flooring, and rubber flooring. Our client is a manufacturer of commercial handheld and power tools for those professional service providers.

## Goals

*   Develop an ideal customer profile from existing Turboship customers.
*   Generate a heat map of where the customers are located.
*   Identify underserved locations, regions, and markets.
*   Generate 100 new customer leads.

## Initiatives

1.  **Ingest Customers**: Import customers from the provided CSV file, tagging them with `turboship`.
2.  **Enrich Customer Data**: For customers with a company address or a custom domain email, perform the following enrichments:
    *   Google Maps search to gather location data, ratings, and reviews.
    *   Website scraping to identify the services they offer.
3.  **Analyze Customer Data**: Analyze the enriched data to identify patterns and insights.
4.  **Generate Leads**: Use the analysis to generate a list of 100 new potential customers.

## Observations

"in Omaha, they're building the Project Health Tower, which should open in 2030. In Orlando, there's a 14-story tower coming next year, and in San Marcos, California, Scripps Health is opening a new campus starting 2025. You can focus on those areas to find flooring installers nearby!"

Keep track of hospital construction using sources like the American Society for Health Care Engineering, which shares annual surveys, and platforms like Definitive Healthcareâ€™s HospitalView, which offers detailed data on new and ongoing healthcare projects.

HospitalView from Definitive Healthcare does include details on construction phases, and it can show whether flooring is needed in those projects.
