 I still wanted to disuss a little bit about questions I had about workflows and steps. I              │
│   think that a campaign might have separate workflows. I think you're calling them phases. I don't know if `transitions` allows          │
│   nested workflows, but that's what we might be trying to do. Or we could have an uber-workflow, or over-workflow, or workflow           │
│   composition. That's what I'm calling a campaign. I want to discuss that a bit more.
