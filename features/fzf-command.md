This application should provide a function called `fzf`.

The `fzf` command would provide a "fuzzy search" interface based on the `fzf` command line tool that would fuzzy search all the companies and people and filter the result as the user types.

It would allow the user to move up and down through the filtered list to select a person or company.

When the user selects a person or company, the application would display that content in the proper view.
