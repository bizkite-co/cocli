# Current Task: Final Review and Completion

This task focuses on a final review of the implemented features and preparing for completion.

## Sub-tasks:

1.  **Final Review of `find` command output**: Verify that the `find` command now correctly displays structured YAML frontmatter data, concatenated tags, and recent meetings.
2.  **Final Review of `importer` command**: Confirm that the importer correctly updates existing records and handles tags as specified.
3.  **Confirm overall functionality**: Ensure all commands (`importer`, `add`, `add-meeting`, `find`, `view-meetings`, `open-company-folder`) are working as expected.
