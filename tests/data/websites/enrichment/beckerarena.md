  \ of 1988, Jim Becker founded Becker Arena Products Inc. Originally known as Becker\
  \ and Associates, the company began as an Olympia Ice Resurfacer Dealership and\
  \ sold various ice rink supplies, dasher boards, and arena equipment as well. With\
  \ a steady client base from the local community and school hockey rinks, the business\
  \ grew quickly \u2013 expanding its product and service offerings at every step.\n\
  In 1994, the company officially became known as Becker Arena Products. This same\
  \ year, the company began manufacturing its own dasher boards \u2013 a system that\
  \ would eventually lead them to Nagano, Japan where its dasher boards were used\
  \ in the construction of the 1998 Olympic Men\u2019s Hockey Rink.\nToday, Becker\
  \ still serves the local hockey rinks and arenas that gave the company its start\
  \ so many years ago. The business\u2019s continued success has given it the opportunity\
  \ to work with clients across North America, Europe, Asia, and Russia. But no matter\
  \ where or how big a project may be, Becker provides each of its clients with the\
  \ highest quality ice rink equipment and attentive customer service.\nBecker Arena\
  \ Products is America\u2019s #1 source for\nrink supplies\nand equipment and has\
  \ helped to build and maintain hundreds of facilities around the world. The company\
  \ is based in Shakopee, Minnesota.\nPhone\n: [\n952-890-2690\n]\nToll Free Phone\n\
